In this respository, the code I have created reflects my understanding of the topic. As you can see, I have completed all of the tasks and
I am ready for my next assignment. We expiremented with the "Archimedes" formula to get a close estimate to pi. We also expiremented with 
some acculalators to create complex equations and solutions. We also expiremented with the Factorial and fibonnaci sequence to understand
how it works. We also made alot of equations that include boolean exprerssions. Also, we created a graph that places random 
points or "darts" to create a blue circle surrounded by a red area outside of it.
